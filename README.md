# Sci.ADS

## Intro

The aim of this package is to provide analytical help for anyone new to R. 
A large number of analyses are performed daily in biology research laboratories. This package contains functions that allow you to easily analyse these data on different points.

## Need ideas

This is the beginning, of course, but this package only needs to be fleshed out by other analysis aids. Do not hesitate to participate in this project either by writing scripts or by giving analysis ideas. 

Thank you for your feedback
